        challenge: "TechFlow Systems, a Pune-based enterprise SaaS provider, was relying entirely on founder-led sales and referrals. They had zero predictable outbound lead generation mechanism, resulting in unpredictable revenue months and inability to forecast growth.",
        solution: "We deployed our 'Lead Gen & Qualification (BOT)' model. Phase 1 involved building a hyper-targeted list of 2000+ CIOs in the Indian manufacturing sector. Phase 2 was crafting a multi-channel outreach sequence. Phase 3 involved our dedicated SDRs running the campaigns and booking qualified meetings (SQLs) for their closing team.",
        outcome: "Within 6 months, we generated 140+ qualified meetings, resulting in ₹2.5 Cr in new pipeline and closing 3 major enterprise contracts worth ₹85 Lakhs. The entire system was then transferred to their in-house team.",

        challenge: "LogiSolutions had decent inbound lead flow but a poor conversion rate of < 2%. They were spending heavily on ads but couldn't understand why leads weren't closing. The sales team blamed marketing for 'bad leads', and marketing blamed sales for 'laziness'.",
        solution: "We conducted a comprehensive 'Sales & Marketing Audit'. We analyzed 500+ past leads, listened to 50+ sales calls, and reviewed their CRM usage. We discovered that 60% of leads were never followed up after the first attempt, and the sales script was completely feature-focused rather than problem-focused.",
